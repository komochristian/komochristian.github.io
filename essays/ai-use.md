# Introduction

## Let me tell you about my classmate…

He is a professional software developer on top of being a world-class physicist, psychologist, mathematician, and expert cook. Too bad you cannot shake his hand, meet ChatGPT. ChatGPT has revolutionized the way I’ve learned in school, and it will definitely change how we do many things. I think one of the biggest areas that ChatGPT has changed is software engineering; developers used to spend hours debugging, reading documentation, and fixing messy codebases. Now AI can do all those boilerplate and boring tasks, leaving more time for software engineers to focus on important things. I find that I’ve had the most success with ChatGPT as well as CoPilot for coding tasks, although ChatGPT holds an edge over CoPilot in terms of coding intelligence. AI is so big that without it, I am not sure how I would have found the time to get through ICS 314.

# Personal Experience with AI

I’ve experimented with LLMs in a variety of ways this semester. Here are some of the ways I have used them:

### Experience WODs

I have used AI in the experience WODs for a variety of tasks, like debugging and understanding code. However, I try not to use it when implementing new features, as I feel like doing these things myself gives me a better understanding of the content. AI is very useful when I ask it to debug things in my program (ex., copying and pasting the error into CoPilot, and describing what I am seeing).

### En-class Practice WODs

I have used AI for practice WODs, from implementing a skeleton of websites to debugging different parts of my program. It made progress a lot easier, especially if the content was new to me (ex., telling AI to make a navbar with different menu settings).

### En-class WODs

AI was essential in getting me through wods. Given the time limit and my unfamiliarity with some programming languages, I used AI for everything, from styling to prototyping and debugging. (ex. telling ChatGPT to create a background image for me on a website).

### Essays

AI was very useful in generating code. If I wanted to show readers examples of what I was talking about, it was quite a time saver.

### Final project

I used AI a lot to like I did my WODs, debugging, prototyping, etc. I also found it helpful how AI was able to find libraries and components online that fit my needs. (Ex. I used ChatGPT to find a slider component suitable for swiping on our website).

### Learning a concept / tutorial

This is probably huge right here. I used AI to explain many things, such as the confusing syntax of React states when I was first starting out, and to generate examples of code that I was able to read and understand on my own. AI has been fundamental to my learning this year.

### Answering a question in class or in Discord

Not really useful because I didn’t really ask many questions in class or on Discord.

### Asking or answering a smart question

I did not really look into smart-questions that much, so this was not so applicable to me.

### Coding example

I used AI a lot to find examples of how to implement libraries or website elements; it was very useful in making progress and understanding code. (ex. explaining how to implement a form in React).

### Explaining code

For really big code bases and files, I found AI quite useful in summarizing what the file was about (ex., explaining the dbActions file in the Next.js template).

### Writing code

I used AI to write a lot of code when I was short on time (ex. implementing the WOD’s prototype skeleton and then making specific edits afterwards.

### Documenting code

Unfortunately, I did not spend much time documenting code in class this semester, so I cannot attest to this as much. However, I have used AI in past documentation efforts, and it was very useful in making detailed documentation in seconds.

### Quality assurance

AI was very useful, especially in explaining ESLint or TypeScript errors. It made debugging a lot quicker and saved me a lot of time (ex., if type hinting was wrong in a function’s signature, Copilot corrected my code).

### Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

# Impact on Learning and Understanding:

AI has been a double-edged sword. I can use AI to explain and give me practical examples that teach me ways to write and implement code. However, getting an answer right away has taken some beauty out of learning, in that I don’t understand as well the underlying concepts that back many aspects of software engineering. Things like Prisma ORM require more research on my end for me to feel more knowledgeable. I think AI can give information in a personalized way, which is good. However, it doesn’t excuse me and others from not putting in the time to learn and understand.

# Practical Applications:

I have used AI outside of my class in a few projects, such as Arduino sensors, Python simulations, and other JavaScript dashboards. Although there are limitations to AI in these projects, such that I had to get my hands dirty myself, AI tools have helped me work on projects at maximum efficiency, and I see myself continuing to use it in the future.

# Challenges and Opportunities:

I would say that while students may learn how to use AI, they don’t understand the concepts behind why AI writes the code that it does. I wish I had spent more time practicing and learning about Next.js and Prisma without AI so that it was more ingrained into my brain. I think that AI should be encouraged in class to be used on projects, but there should be WODs or exams given where students cannot use AI, that way it encourages more learning and less outputting.

# Comparative Analysis:

For practical skills, I think AI use should be encouraged, as this will be the new paradigm for how we software developers work on projects in the future. For knowledge retention, though, I would discourage AI use as it only teaches students to copy and paste from LLMs without understanding what they are pasting. I think engagement is about the same, but one thing I think AI will change is what goes on in the classroom. With less time spent on technical aspects, I think soft skills and social interaction will be greatly encouraged more, as these are the skills leaders and managers will need.

# Future Considerations:

As I mentioned before, I think AI use should be encouraged to allow students to gain experience with it, but it should not be used as a crutch to get students through class. I think we should bring back to classrooms learning without AI again, or at least with limited usage. Only this way can students have a perfect blend of AI knowledge and human understanding.

# Conclusion:

To summarize, I think that AI is a powerful tool that software students will need to know how to use to succeed in today’s society. However, AI is so new that we haven’t even seen the long-term effects on students yet, or how they learn. I believe AI should be incorporated more slowly within the curriculum in order to let teachers see the long-term effects of AI usage on education.

Thank you, ChatGPT and Copilot with helping me with this year’s 314 class, kudos to you!
