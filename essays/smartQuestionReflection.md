## Smart Question

[Smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22876978/loop-inside-react-jsx )

In our example above, our smart question is a Stack Overflow form titled “Loop inside React JSX” where the developer explains their issue with attempting to use a traditional for loop inside JSX syntax. However, by adding context to the question by mentioning their background in template-based environments, the readers begin to understand why they are confused. This question demonstrates a classic smart question, backed by the Stack Overflow community with 2000+ votes. Notably, the asker shows they’ve already attempted a solution, explains what they expected, and provides a minimal, focused code example that isolates the problem, and so the community was able to offer efficient solutions, including constructing arrays of JSX elements using a loop outside the JSX return or using the .map() method. This example clearly illustrates how asking questions the “smart” way leads to helpful, thorough, and educational answers that not only solve the problem but also deepen the asker’s understanding of the technology.

## Bad Question

From ChatGPT, here is an example of a bad question:

Title: "Why isn't my code working??? 😡"

Body: "I've been trying to get this C++ program to work all day and it's not doing anything. I copied it from a tutorial, but it keeps giving me some weird error. Can someone please just tell me what's wrong? Here's the code:"

This question immediately signals frustration and a lack of professionalism. The body of the post provides minimal context: the user says they copied code from a tutorial, received a vague “weird error,” and then asks for help without specifying any context or what went wrong. This question violates several guidelines; first of all, it lacks evidence of prior troubleshooting efforts. Second, it fails to describe the problem clearly. There is no information about the environment, compiler, or inputs, and no clarification of what “not doing anything” means. Third, the tone is written in a rude, unprofessional manner, which discourages contributors from engaging. Because this approach is very vague and  messy, it is difficult for others to provide help. In contrast to smart questions that invite thoughtful responses and teach the asker something valuable, this type of post tends to waste both the asker’s and the community’s time. Next time, the user should do some debugging on their own, before asking the internet in a polite manner, explaining what they have already done to  attempt to solve the issue.

## The Difference

The major differences between the two categories of questions, I guess, come down to professionalism and treating contributors as a helping hand instead of an online servant. Instead of expecting the contributor to do all the work of debugging, such as running code and running through logs, it should be expected for the questioner to do some debugging on their own end and try to understand the issue, and perhaps something new. Additionally, being specific never hurts and can even speed up the debugging process for contributors. Finally, contributing to a non-toxic development community by maintaining polite language is always welcome. Teachers always say that there are no stupid questions. While this is true, there might sometimes be people acting stupidly behind those questions.
