## Smart Question

[Smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22876978/loop-inside-react-jsx )

In our example above, our smart question is a Stack Overflow form is titled ‚ÄúLoop inside React JSX‚Äù where the developer explains their issue with attempting to use a traditional for loop inside JSX syntax. However, by adding context to the question by mentioning their background in template-based environments, the readers begin to understand why they are confused. This question demonstrates a classic smart question, backed by the Stack Overflow community with 2000+ votes. Notably, the asker shows they‚Äôve already attempted a solution, explains what they expected, and provides a minimal, focused code example that isolates the problem, and so the community was able to offer efficient solutions, including constructing arrays of JSX elements using a loop outside the JSX return or using the .map() method. This example clearly illustrates how asking questions the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù way leads to helpful, thorough, and educational answers that not only solve the problem but also deepen the asker‚Äôs understanding of the technology.

## Bad Question

From ChatGPT, here is an example of a bad question:

Title: "Why isn't my code working??? üò°"

Body: "I've been trying to get this C++ program to work all day and it's not doing anything. I copied it from a tutorial, but it keeps giving me some weird error. Can someone please just tell me what's wrong? Here's the code:"


This question immediately signals frustration and a lack of professionalism. The body of the post provides minimal context: the user says they copied code from a tutorial, received a vague ‚Äúweird error,‚Äù and then asks for help without specifying any context or what went wrong. This question violates several guidelines, first of all, it lacks evidence of prior troubleshooting efforts. Second, it fails to describe the problem clearly. There is no information about the environment, compiler, inputs, and no clarification of what ‚Äúnot doing anything‚Äù means. Third, the tone is written rudely unprofessional, which discourages contributors from engaging. Because of this vague and unstructured approach, it is difficult for others to provide help. In contrast to smart questions that invite thoughtful responses and teach the asker something valuable, this type of vague, frustrated post tends to waste both the asker‚Äôs and the community‚Äôs time.

## The Difference

The major differences between the two categories of questions I guess comes down to professionalism and treating contributers as a helping hand instead of an online servant. Insted of expecting the contributer to do all the work of debugging, such as running code and running through logs, it should be expected for the questioner to do some debugging on their own end and try to understand the issue and perhaps something new. Additionally, being specific never hurts and can even speed up the debugging process for contributers. Finally, contributing to a non-toxic development community by maintaining polite language is always welcome.
