#  Introduction

For the longest time, since I have been learning to code when I was in middle school, I thought I knew software engineering. You write code that does some cool computer thing, like generating 3d graphics for a video game, sending money to a family member, or making a robot move from point A to B. Even when I entered college, I only thought software engineering consisted of what programming languages you knew to code in, which is where I based much of my time and resources early in my undergraduate degree. However, it wasn’t until even a few months ago, before software engineering at UH Manoa, that I began to realize what it meant to be a software engineer. Beyond writing code, it also consists of… writing code that is good. Just kidding, on top of that, you must also focus on networking, standard configurations, unit testing, ensuring secure protocols, configuring databases, and, of course, debugging. All these things are to ensure that the life cycle of a piece of software is running healthily. Here are some of the topics I learned about that go beyond just writing code for web development:

#  Coding standards: embarassing...

Coding standards have been embarrassing me all semester long. When I first ran ESLint on my codebase, no lie, I spent about 45 minutes getting all the formatting errors out of my system. After this class, though, I could definitely see the advantage of using coding standards. It makes files easy to read and debug, allowing for a better collaborative experience between software developers. Although quite annoying at times, I am thankful for design standards. Not just in for code, but in the world around us. Without standards, we would not have the clean user experience we have today for popular video games, Google apps, movie streaming platforms, and much more. In real life, safe to say, it would be unwise if we designed buildings, bridges, and airports without proper standards. Messy systems are bound to break down, and the last thing I want to find myself in is an airport when everything is breaking down.

#  Blowing up rockets

The next thing I learned a lot about in software engineering is agile project management. Agile project management follows a cycle of analysis, design, development, testing, and deployment in order to create efficient software at a fast pace. I think the concept behind this is simple, but when you think about it in context, it can become amazing how wonderful this process is for developers. It has been said that SpaceX engineers and researchers actually cheer when their rockets crash, because SpaceX has a motto of failing fast. When you fail fast, you learn quicker about what went wrong, which allows you to fix your mistakes. Thus, the faster you fail, the faster your product or system gets better. I think this is a great analogy to look at when thinking about agile project management. This process allows for rapid development and deployment of software, while leaving room for flexibility and error. Agile project management reminds me that failure is always necessary to reach success.

#  Conclusion

In conclusion, I have learned a lot about not just software engineering, but engineering in real life too. I have learned how to build clean, secure systems that are reliable and have room for workability and collaboration. I am not well-versed in everything yet, which is why I’m glad that I am young and that software engineering is a lifelong learning process.
