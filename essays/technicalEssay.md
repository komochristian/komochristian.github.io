## A spark is birthed

Growing up, I always loved the digital world. Being born and raised in a modern country like Singapore, I always had an interest in technology and computers. Playing Minecraft as a youth, I was always experimenting and following online tutorials on installing mods on my computer. The process was always messy and often failed, but it instilled a lot of curiosity into me as I transitioned into block coding and playing other people’s video games. I also grew a knack for handcrafted projects, as I would enjoy making paper toy guns that I would annoy my sisters with by shooting paper darts at them.

## The flame grows

 Now, as a college student, I’ve combined my life interests in technology and engineering with the disciplined skills I’ve gained. With computer logic and software development, I enjoy creating web applications for real-world problems, such as simulating particle physics. I am also passionate about bridging my engineering skills with software skills. I have done this through projects that aim to solve dire problems in society, such as a robotic platform that uses computer vision to help farmers combat aging and labor issues, and creating atmospheric pressure sensors using Arduino to help Physics professors at my university run experiments on interstellar objects within vacuum chambers.

## Looking for fuel

 As I leave college, I am not sure what my career will look like. Technology is expanding at a rate faster than ever. AI and new tech will certainly shape the way we think about engineering and being software developers. However, I fully believe that if I follow my passions and interests, I will be able to adapt to any new system or status quo. Hiral Nigdal says it best,

“The sparkle in your eyes which shows up when you do what you love, becomes a starting point to a grand carnival of your new life”.
