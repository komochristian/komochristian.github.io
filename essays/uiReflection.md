# Back in my day...

When computers were on their rise in the 70s to the 80s, they could do many things better than humans, such as calculating numbers and enabling instantaneous communication; however, there was one basic thing that computers could not do that us humans have been doing since we were born...

# Circles

Well, not exactly circles, but when drawing curved edges and other curves, computers struggled greatly with the math behind drawing these curves. Although this was a proud victory us humans could claim over machines for some time, unfortunately, innovation caught up to us and now, more than just drawing circles, computers can effortlessly take our jobs. However, I'm not here to discuss about unemployment and AI, I'm here to discuss how computers have gotten very good at designing and making UIs.

# UIs??

UIs (User Interfaces), as I like to think of them, are just ways of translating computer interfaces into human friendly interfaces. While computer software talks to hardware through 1s and 0s, humans interact with software through the most simple physical action: The push of a button, and it has been quite effective for the past many decades. However simple most UI designs may seem at first, underneath, there are a lot of complex systems that work together to produce the design. These underlying systems can be so complicated that there are full time careers dedicated to designing these systems: software frontend engineers. I myself am more of a backend type of guy. Although I like making things look cool and pretty, some things about frontend engineering throw me off. Take, for example, the following HTML code


```html
 <!-- Navbar -->
  <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light shadow mb-4">
    <div class="container-fluid">:
      <a class="navbar-brand text-blue-600 font-bold" href="#">MessySite</a>
      <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarNav"
        aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
      </button>
      <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
        <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
          <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link active text-red-500" aria-current="page" href="#">Home</a></li>
          <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link text-green-600" href="#">Features</a></li>
          <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link text-yellow-500" href="#">Pricing</a></li>
          <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link disabled" href="#" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true">Disabled</a></li>
        </ul>
        <form class="d-flex" role="search">
          <input class="form-control me-2 rounded-lg border-blue-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600"
            type="search" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search">
          <button class="btn btn-outline-success px-3 py-1 bg-green-200 text-sm hover:bg-green-300" type="submit">Search</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </div>
  </nav>
```

For me, it is easier and less of a headache to read and create safe APIs and server systems than to debug long bootstrap or Tailwind code. Even with the simplification that frameworks like Bootstrap offer, I would rather stay out of that domain if I can. I'm thankful for these frameworks too, as they make creating different styles and components super easy and intuitive. I find it's odd that I have a lot more comfortability with more functional frontend frameworks like React than simple basic HTML, perhaps with experience one day I may call myself the mythical...
