# Back in my day...

When computers were on their rise in the 70s to the 80s, they could do many things better than humans, such as calculating numbers and instantaneous communication, however, there was one basic thing that computers could not do that us humans have been doing since we were born.

# Circles

Well, not exactly circles, but when drawing curved edges and other curves, computers struggled greatly with the math behind drawing these curves. Although this was a proud victory us humans could claim over machines for some time, unfortunately, innovation caught up to us and now computers can effortlessly take jobs. However, I'm not here to discuss about unemployment and AI, I'm here to discuss how computers have gotten very good at designing and making UIs.

## UI??

UIs (User Interfaces) as I like to think of them are just ways to translating computer interfaces into human friendly interfaces. While computer softwares talk to hardware through 1s and 0s.
